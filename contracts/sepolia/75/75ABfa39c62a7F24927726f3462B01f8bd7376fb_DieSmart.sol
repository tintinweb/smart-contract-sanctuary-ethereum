/**
 * @dev A library for populating CBOR encoded payload in Solidity.
 *
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7049
 *
 * The library offers various write* and start* methods to encode values of different types.
 * The resulted buffer can be obtained with data() method.
 * Encoding of primitive types is staightforward, whereas encoding of sequences can result
 * in an invalid CBOR if start/write/end flow is violated.
 * For the purpose of gas saving, the library does not verify start/write/end flow internally,
 * except for nested start/end pairs.
