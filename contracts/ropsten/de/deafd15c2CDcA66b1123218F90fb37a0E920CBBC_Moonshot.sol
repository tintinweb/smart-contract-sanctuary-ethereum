Moonshot is a deflationary, frictionless yield and liquidity protocol.

For every transaction, a fee of max. 10% is decucted and shared between holders, the liqduity pool and the dev/marketing wallet.
As the burn address participates as a holder, the supply is forever decreasing.

Started out at DEFI meme token, moonshot features MoonBoxes and MoonSea.
