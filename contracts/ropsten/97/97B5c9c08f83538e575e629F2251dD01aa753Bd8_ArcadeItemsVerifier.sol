/**
 * @title ArcadeItemsVerifier
 * @author Non-Fungible Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * This contract can be used for verifying complex signature-encoded
 * bundle descriptions. This resolves on a new array of SignatureItems[],
 * which outside of verification, is passed around as bytes memory.
 *
 * Each SignatureItem has four fields:
 *      - cType (collateral Type)
 *      - asset (contract address of the asset)
 *      - tokenId (token ID of the asset, if applicable)
 *      - amount (amount of the asset, if applicable)
 *
 * - For token ids part of ERC721, other features beyond direct tokenIds are supported:
 *      - A provided token id of -1 is a wildcard, meaning any token ID is accepted.
 *      - Wildcard token ids are not supported for ERC1155.
 * - All amounts are taken as minimums. For instance, if the "amount" field of an ERC1155 is 5,
 *      then a bundle with 8 of those ERC1155s are accepted.
 * - For an ERC20 cType, tokenId is ignored. For an ERC721 cType, amount is ignored.
 *
 * - Any deviation from the above rules represents an unparseable signature and will always
 *      return invalid.
 *
 * - All multi-item signatures assume AND - any optional expressed by OR
 *      can be implemented by simply signing multiple separate signatures.
