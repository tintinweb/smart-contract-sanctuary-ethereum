// MODIFICATIONS
// Checkpointing logic from Comp.sol has been used with the following modifications:
// - `delegates` is renamed to `_delegates` and is set to private
// - `delegates` is a public function that uses the `_delegates` mapping look-up, but unlike
//   Comp.sol, returns the delegator's own address if there is no delegate.
//   This avoids the delegator needing to "delegate to self" with an additional transaction
// - `_transferTokens()` is renamed `_beforeTokenTransfer()` and adapted to hook into OpenZeppelin's ERC721 hooks.
