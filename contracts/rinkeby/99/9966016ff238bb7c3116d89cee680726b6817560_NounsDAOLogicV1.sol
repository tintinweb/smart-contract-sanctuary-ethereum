//
// MODIFICATIONS
// NounsDAOLogicV1 adds:
// - Proposal Threshold basis points instead of fixed number
//   due to the Noun token's increasing supply
//
// - Quorum Votes basis points instead of fixed number
//   due to the Noun token's increasing supply
//
// - Per proposal storing of fixed `proposalThreshold`
//   and `quorumVotes` calculated using the Noun token's total supply
//   at the block the proposal was created and the basis point parameters
//
// - `ProposalCreatedWithRequirements` event that emits `ProposalCreated` parameters with
//   the addition of `proposalThreshold` and `quorumVotes`
//
// - Votes are counted from the block a proposal is created instead of
//   the proposal's voting start block to align with the parameters
//   stored with the proposal
//
// - Veto ability which allows `veteor` to halt any proposal at any stage unless
//   the proposal is executed.
//   The `veto(uint proposalId)` logic is a modified version of `cancel(uint proposalId)`
//   A `vetoed` flag was added to the `Proposal` struct to support this.
//
// NounsDAOLogicV1 removes:
// - `initialProposalId` and `_initiate()` due to this being the
//   first instance of the governance contract unlike
//   GovernorBravo which upgrades GovernorAlpha
//
// - Value passed along using `timelock.executeTransaction{value: proposal.value}`
//   in `execute(uint proposalId)`. This contract should not hold funds and does not
//   implement `receive()` or `fallback()` functions.
