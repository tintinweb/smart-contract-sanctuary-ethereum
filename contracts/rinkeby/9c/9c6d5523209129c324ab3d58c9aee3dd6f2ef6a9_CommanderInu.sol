 *    With a dynamic sell limit based on price impact and increasing sell cooldowns and redistribution taxes on consecutive sells, Myōbu was designed to reward holders and discourage dumping.
 *
 *    1. Buy limit and cooldown timer on buys to make sure no automated bots have a chance to snipe big portions of the pool.
 *    2. No Team & Marketing wallet. 100% of the tokens will come on the market for trade. 
 *    3. No presale wallets that can dump on the community. 
 *
 *    Token Information
 *    1. 1,000,000,000,000 Total Supply
 *    2. Developer provides LP
 *    3. Fair launch for everyone! 
 *    4. Sells limited to 3% of the Liquidity Pool, <2.9% price impact 
 *    5. Sell cooldown increases on consecutive sells, 4 sells within a 5 minutes period are allowed
 *    6. 2% redistribution to holders on all buys
 *    7. 7% redistribution to holders on the first sell, increases 2x, 3x, 4x on consecutive sells
 *    8. Redistribution actually works!
 *    9. 5-6% developer fee split within the team
