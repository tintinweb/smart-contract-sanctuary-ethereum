 * -------------------------- Disambiguation & Other Notes ---------------------
 *    - The term "head" is used as it is in the documentation for ABI encoding,
 *      but only in reference to dynamic types, i.e. it always refers to the
 *      offset or pointer to the body of a dynamic type. In calldata, the head
 *      is always an offset (relative to the parent object), while in memory,
 *      the head is always the pointer to the body. More information found here:
 *      https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.14/abi-spec.html#argument-encoding
 *        - Note that the length of an array is separate from and precedes the
 *          head of the array.
 *
 *    - The term "body" is used in place of the term "head" used in the ABI
 *      documentation. It refers to the start of the data for a dynamic type,
 *      e.g. the first word of a struct or the first word of the first element
 *      in an array.
 *
 *    - The term "pointer" is used to describe the absolute position of a value
 *      and never an offset relative to another value.
 *        - The suffix "_ptr" refers to a memory pointer.
 *        - The suffix "_cdPtr" refers to a calldata pointer.
 *
 *    - The term "offset" is used to describe the position of a value relative
 *      to some parent value. For example, OrderParameters_conduit_offset is the
 *      offset to the "conduit" value in the OrderParameters struct relative to
 *      the start of the body.
 *        - Note: Offsets are used to derive pointers.
 *
 *    - Some structs have pointers defined for all of their fields in this file.
 *      Lines which are commented out are fields that are not used in the

 *      in an array.
 *
 *    - The term "pointer" is used to describe the absolute position of a value

 *        - The suffix "_ptr" refers to a memory pointer.
 *        - The suffix "_cdPtr" refers to a calldata pointer.
