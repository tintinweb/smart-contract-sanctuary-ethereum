/**
  @title A contract for minting ERC-721 items given an ERC-20 token burn and
    ownership of some prerequisite ERC-721 items.
  @author 0xthrpw
  @author Tim Clancy

  This contract allows for the configuration of multiple redemption rounds. Each
  redemption round is configured with a set of ERC-721 item collection addresses
  in the `redemptionCriteria` mapping that any prospective redeemers must hold.

  Each redemption round is also configured with a redemption configuration per
  the `redemptionConfigs` mapping. This configuration allows a caller holding
  the required ERC-721 items to mint some amount `amountOut` of a new ERC-721
  `tokenOut` item in exchange for burning `price` amount of a `payingToken`
  ERC-20 token.

  Any ERC-721 collection being minted by this redeemer must grant minting
  permissions to this contract in some fashion. Users must also approve this
  contract to spend any requisite `payingToken` ERC-20 tokens on their behalf.
