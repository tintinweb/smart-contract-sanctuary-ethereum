/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

/// @title MajorityVotingBase
/// @author Aragon Association - 2022-2023

/// @notice The abstract implementation of majority voting plugins.
///
/// #### Parameterization
///
/// We define two parameters
/// $$\texttt{support} = \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes} + N_\text{no}} \in [0,1]$$
/// and
/// $$\texttt{participation} = \frac{N_\text{yes} + N_\text{no} + N_\text{abstain}}{N_\text{total}} \in [0,1],$$
/// where $N_\text{yes}$, $N_\text{no}$, and $N_\text{abstain}$ are the yes, no, and abstain votes that have been cast and $N_\text{total}$ is the total voting power available at /// proposal creation time.
///
/// ##### Limit Values: Support Threshold & Minimum Participation
///
/// Two limit values are associated with these parameters and decide if a proposal execution should be possible: $\texttt{supportThreshold} \in [0,1]$ and $\texttt{minParticipation} \in /// [0,1]$.
///
/// For threshold values, $>$ comparison is used. This **does not** include the threshold value. E.g., for $\texttt{supportThreshold} = 50\%$, the criterion is fulfilled if there is at /// least one more yes than no votes ($N_\text{yes} = N_\text{no} + 1 $).
/// For minimum values, $\ge$ comparison is used. This **does** include the minimum participation value. E.g., for $\texttt{minParticipation} = 40\%$ and $N_\text{total} = 10$, the /// criterion is fulfilled if 4 out of 10 votes were casted.
///
/// Majority voting implies that the support threshold is set with
/// $$\texttt{supportThreshold} \ge 50\% .$$
/// However, this is not enforced by the contract code and developers can make unsafe parameters and only the frontend will warn about bad parameter settings.
///
/// #### Execution Criteria
///
/// After the vote is closed, two criteria decide if the proposal passes.
///
/// ##### The Support Criterion
///
/// For a proposal to pass, the required ratio of yes and no votes must be met:
/// $$(1- \texttt{supportThreshold}) \cdot N_\text{yes} > \texttt{supportThreshold} \cdot N_\text{no}.$$
/// Note, that the inequality yields the simple majority voting condition for $\texttt{supportThreshold}=\frac{1}{2}$.
///
/// ##### The Participation Criterion
///
/// For a proposal to pass, the minimum voting power must have been cast:
/// $$N_\text{yes} + N_\text{no} + N_\text{abstain} \ge \texttt{minVotingPower},$$
/// where $\texttt{minVotingPower} = \texttt{minParticipation} \cdot N_\text{total}$.
///
/// #### Vote Replacement Execution
///
/// The contract allows votes to be replaced. Voters can vote multiple times and only the latest voteOption is tallied.
///
/// #### Early Execution
///
/// This contract allows a proposal to be executed early, iff the vote outcome cannot change anymore by more people voting. Accordingly, vote replacement and early execution are /// mutually exclusive options.
/// The outcome cannot change anymore iff the support threshold is met even if all remaining votes are no votes. We call this number the worst-case number of no votes and define it as
///
/// $$N_\text{no, worst-case} = N_\text{no, worst-case} + \texttt{remainingVotes}$$
///
/// where
///
/// $$\texttt{remainingVotes} = N_\text{total}-\underbrace{(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})}_{\text{turnout}}.$$
///
/// We can use this quantity to calculate the worst-case support that would be obtained if all remaining votes are casted with no:
///
/// $$
/// \begin{align*}
///   \texttt{worstCaseSupport}
///   &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes} + (N_\text{no, worst-case})} \\[3mm]
///   &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes} + (N_\text{no} + \texttt{remainingVotes})} \\[3mm]
///   &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes} +  N_\text{no} + N_\text{total} - (N_\text{yes} + N_\text{no} + N_\text{abstain})} \\[3mm]
///   &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{total} - N_\text{abstain}}
/// \end{align*}
/// $$
///
/// In analogy, we can modify [the support criterion](#the-support-criterion) from above to allow for early execution:
///
/// $$
/// \begin{align*}
///   (1 - \texttt{supportThreshold}) \cdot N_\text{yes}
///   &> \texttt{supportThreshold} \cdot  N_\text{no, worst-case} \\[3mm]
///   &> \texttt{supportThreshold} \cdot (N_\text{no} + \texttt{remainingVotes}) \\[3mm]
///   &> \texttt{supportThreshold} \cdot (N_\text{no} + N_\text{total}-(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})) \\[3mm]
///   &> \texttt{supportThreshold} \cdot (N_\text{total} - N_\text{yes} - N_\text{abstain})
/// \end{align*}
