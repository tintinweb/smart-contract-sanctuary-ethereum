/**
 * @dev This library provides functions to help manipulating samples for Pool Price Oracles. It handles updates,
 * encoding, and decoding of samples.
 *
 * Each sample holds the timestamp of its last update, plus information about three pieces of data: the price pair, the
 * price of BPT (the associated Pool token), and the invariant.
 *
 * Prices and invariant are not stored directly: instead, we store their logarithm. These are known as the 'instant'
 * values: the exact value at that timestamp.
 *
 * Additionally, for each value we keep an accumulator with the sum of all past values, each weighted by the time
 * elapsed since the previous update. This lets us later subtract accumulators at different points in time and divide by
 * the time elapsed between them, arriving at the geometric mean of the values (also known as log-average).
 *
 * All samples are stored in a single 256 bit word with the following structure:
 *
 * [    log pair price     |        bpt price      |       invariant       |  timestamp ]
 * [ instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator | instant | accumulator |            ]

 *
 * Assuming the timestamp doesn't overflow (which holds until the year 2038), the largest elapsed time is 2^31, which
