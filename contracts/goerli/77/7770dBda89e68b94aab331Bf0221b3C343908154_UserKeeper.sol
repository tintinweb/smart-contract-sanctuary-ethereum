/**
 *  @notice This library is used to convert numbers that use token's N decimals to M decimals.
 *  Comes extremely handy with standardizing the business logic that is intended to work with many different ERC20 tokens
 *  that have different precision (decimals). One can perform calculations with 18 decimals only and resort to convertion
 *  only when the payouts (or interactions) with the actual tokes have to be made.
 *
 *  The best usage scenario involves accepting and calculating values with 18 decimals throughout the project, despite the tokens decimals.
 *
 *  Also it is recommended to call `round18()` function on the first execution line in order to get rid of the
 *  trailing numbers if the destination decimals are less than 18
 *
 *  Example:
 *
 *  contract Taker {
 *      ERC20 public USDC;
 *      uint256 public paid;
 *
 *      . . .
 *
 *      function pay(uint256 amount) external {
 *          uint256 decimals = USDC.decimals();
 *          amount = amount.round18(decimals);
 *
 *          paid += amount;
 *          USDC.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount.from18(decimals));
 *      }
