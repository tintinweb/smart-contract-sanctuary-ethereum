/// @notice `ITierV2` is a simple interface that contracts can implement to
/// provide membership lists for other contracts.
///
/// There are many use-cases for a time-preserving conditional membership list.
///
/// Some examples include:
///
/// - Self-serve whitelist to participate in fundraising
/// - Lists of users who can claim airdrops and perks
/// - Pooling resources with implied governance/reward tiers
/// - POAP style attendance proofs allowing access to future exclusive events
///
/// @dev Standard interface to a tiered membership.
///
/// A "membership" can represent many things:
/// - Exclusive access.
/// - Participation in some event or process.
/// - KYC completion.
/// - Combination of sub-memberships.
/// - Etc.
///
/// The high level requirements for a contract implementing `ITierV2`:
/// - MUST represent held tiers as a `uint`.
/// - MUST implement `report`.
///   - The report is a `uint256` that SHOULD represent the time each tier has
///     been continuously held since encoded as `uint32`.
///   - The encoded tiers start at `1`; Tier `0` is implied if no tier has ever
///     been held.
///   - Tier `0` is NOT encoded in the report, it is simply the fallback value.
///   - If a tier is lost the time data is erased for that tier and will be
///     set if/when the tier is regained to the new time.
///   - If a tier is held but the historical time information is not available
///     the report MAY return `0x00000000` for all held tiers.
///   - Tiers that are lost or have never been held MUST return `0xFFFFFFFF`.
///   - Context can be a list of numbers that MAY pairwise define tiers such as
///     minimum thresholds, or MAY simply provide global context such as a
///     relevant NFT ID for example.
/// - MUST implement `reportTimeForTier`
///   - Functions exactly as `report` but only returns a single time for a
///     single tier
///   - MUST return the same time value `report` would for any given tier and
///     context combination.
///
/// So the four possible states and report values are:
/// - Tier is held and time is known: Timestamp is in the report
/// - Tier is held but time is NOT known: `0` is in the report
/// - Tier is NOT held: `0xFF..` is in the report
/// - Tier is unknown: `0xFF..` is in the report
///
/// The reason `context` is specified as a list of values rather than arbitrary
/// bytes is to allow clear and efficient compatibility with VM stacks. Some N
/// values can be taken from a VM stack and used directly as a context, which
/// would be difficult or impossible to ensure is safe for arbitrary bytes.

    /// This DOES NOT apply to all contracts, an obvious example is token

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
