     * @param verificationGasLimit gas used for validateUserOp and validatePaymasterUserOp
     * @param preVerificationGas gas not calculated by the handleOps method, but added to the gas paid. Covers batch overhead.
     * @param maxFeePerGas same as EIP-1559 gas parameter
     * @param maxPriorityFeePerGas same as EIP-1559 gas parameter
     * @param paymasterAndData if set, this field hold the paymaster address and "paymaster-specific-data". the paymaster will pay for the transaction instead of the sender
     * @param signature sender-verified signature over the entire request, the EntryPoint address and the chain ID.
