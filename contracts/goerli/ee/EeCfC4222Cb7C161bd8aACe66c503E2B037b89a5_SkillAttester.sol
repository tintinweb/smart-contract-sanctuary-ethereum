 * @title  Skill Attester
 * @author Sahil Vasava (https://github.com/sahilvasava)
 * @notice This attester uses ERC721/ERC1155 balance to generate attestations.
 * Skill attester enables users to generate attestations based on amount of tokens based on weights given to those tokens stored in Skill badge contract.
 * The basic idea to map different ERC721/ERC1155 (including cred badges in attestation registry) to skills with specific weights attached.
 *
 * Skill Token amount = Cred Badge[0] * Weight[0] + Cred Badge[1] * Weight[1] + ... + Cred Badge[n] * Weight[n]
