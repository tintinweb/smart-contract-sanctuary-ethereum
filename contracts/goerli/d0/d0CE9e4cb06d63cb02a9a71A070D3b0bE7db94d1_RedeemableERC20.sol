/// `Phase.ONE` is the redemption phase where the token can be redeemed but no
/// longer transferred.
///
/// Redeeming some amount of `RedeemableERC20` burns the token in exchange for
/// some other tokens held by the contract. For example, if the
/// `RedeemableERC20` token contract holds 100 000 USDC then a holder of the
/// redeemable token can burn some of their tokens to receive a % of that USDC.
/// If they redeemed (burned) an amount equal to 10% of the redeemable token

///
/// To make the treasury assets discoverable anyone can call `newTreasuryAsset`
/// to emit an event containing the treasury asset address. As malicious and/or
/// spam users can emit many treasury events there is a need for sensible
/// indexing and filtering of asset events to only trusted users. This contract
/// is agnostic to how that trust relationship is defined for each user.
///
/// Users must specify all the treasury assets they wish to redeem to the
/// `redeem` function. After `redeem` is called the redeemed tokens are burned
/// so all treasury assets must be specified and claimed in a batch atomically.
/// Note: The same amount of `RedeemableERC20` is burned, regardless of which
/// treasury assets were specified. Specifying fewer assets will NOT increase
/// the proportion of each that is returned.
///
/// `RedeemableERC20` has several owner administrative functions:
/// - Owner can add senders and receivers that can send/receive tokens even
///   during `Phase.ONE`
/// - Owner can end `Phase.ONE` during `Phase.ZERO` by specifying the address
///   of a distributor, which will have any undistributed tokens burned.
/// The owner should be a `Trust` not an EOA.
///
/// The redeem functions MUST be used to redeem and burn RedeemableERC20s
/// (NOT regular transfers).
///
/// `redeem` will simply revert if called outside `Phase.ONE`.
/// A `Redeem` event is emitted on every redemption (per treasury asset) as

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
