 * @dev Implementation of the ERC2309 "Consecutive Transfer Extension" as defined in
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309[EIP-2309].
 *
 * This extension allows the minting of large batches of tokens, during contract construction only. For upgradeable
 * contracts this implies that batch minting is only available during proxy deployment, and not in subsequent upgrades.
 * These batches are limited to 5000 tokens at a time by default to accommodate off-chain indexers.
 *
 * Using this extension removes the ability to mint single tokens during contract construction. This ability is
 * regained after construction. During construction, only batch minting is allowed.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This extension bypasses the hooks {_beforeTokenTransfer} and {_afterTokenTransfer} for tokens minted in
 * batch. When using this extension, you should consider the {_beforeConsecutiveTokenTransfer} and
 * {_afterConsecutiveTokenTransfer} hooks in addition to {_beforeTokenTransfer} and {_afterTokenTransfer}.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: When overriding {_afterTokenTransfer}, be careful about call ordering. {ownerOf} may return invalid
 * values during the {_afterTokenTransfer} execution if the super call is not called first. To be safe, execute the
 * super call before your custom logic.
