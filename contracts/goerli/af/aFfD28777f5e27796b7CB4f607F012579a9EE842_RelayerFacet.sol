/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

library TypedMemView {
  // Why does this exist?
  // the solidity `bytes memory` type has a few weaknesses.
  // 1. You can't index ranges effectively
  // 2. You can't slice without copying
  // 3. The underlying data may represent any type
  // 4. Solidity never deallocates memory, and memory costs grow
  //    superlinearly

  // By using a memory view instead of a `bytes memory` we get the following
  // advantages:
  // 1. Slices are done on the stack, by manipulating the pointer
  // 2. We can index arbitrary ranges and quickly convert them to stack types
  // 3. We can insert type info into the pointer, and typecheck at runtime

  // This makes `TypedMemView` a useful tool for efficient zero-copy
  // algorithms.

  // Why bytes29?
  // We want to avoid confusion between views, digests, and other common
  // types so we chose a large and uncommonly used odd number of bytes
  //
  // Note that while bytes are left-aligned in a word, integers and addresses
  // are right-aligned. This means when working in assembly we have to
  // account for the 3 unused bytes on the righthand side
  //
  // First 5 bytes are a type flag.
  // - ff_ffff_fffe is reserved for unknown type.
  // - ff_ffff_ffff is reserved for invalid types/errors.
  // next 12 are memory address
  // next 12 are len
  // bottom 3 bytes are empty

  // Assumptions:
  // - non-modification of memory.
  // - No Solidity updates
  // - - wrt free mem point
  // - - wrt bytes representation in memory
  // - - wrt memory addressing in general

  // Usage:
  // - create type constants
  // - use `assertType` for runtime type assertions
  // - - unfortunately we can't do this at compile time yet :(
  // - recommended: implement modifiers that perform type checking
  // - - e.g.
  // - - `uint40 constant MY_TYPE = 3;`
  // - - ` modifer onlyMyType(bytes29 myView) { myView.assertType(MY_TYPE); }`
  // - instantiate a typed view from a bytearray using `ref`
  // - use `index` to inspect the contents of the view
