/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }

/// @author Aragon Association - 2022
/// @notice The interface of majority voting plugin.
///
///  #### Parameterization
///  We define two parameters
///  $$\texttt{support} = \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}}$$
///  and
///  $$\texttt{participation} = \frac{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain}}{N_\text{total}}$$
///  where $N_\text{yes}$, $N_\text{no}$, and $N_\text{abstain}$ are the yes, no, and abstain votes that have been casted and $N_\text{total}$ is the total voting power available at proposal creation time.
///  Majority voting implies that the support threshold is set with
///  $$\texttt{supportThreshold} \ge 50\% .$$
///  However, this is not enforced by the contract code and developers can make unsafe parameterss and only the frontend will warn about bad parameter settings.
///
///  #### Vote Replacement Execution
///  The contract allows votes to be replaced. Voters can change their vote multiple times and only the latest vote option is tallied.
///
///  #### Early Execution
///  This contract allows a proposal to be executed early, iff the vote outcome cannot change anymore by more voters voting. Accordingly, vote replacement and early execution are mutually exclusive options.
///  $$\texttt{remainingVotes} = N_\text{total}-\underbrace{(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})}_{\text{turnout}}$$
///  We use this quantity to calculate the worst case support that would be obtained if all remaining votes are casted with no:
///  $$\begin{align*}
///    \texttt{worstCaseSupport}
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+(N_\text{no} + \texttt{remainingVotes})}
///    \\[3mm]
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no} + N_\text{total}-(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})}
///    \\[3mm]
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{ N_\text{total}-N_\text{abstain}}
///  \end{align*}$$
///  Accordingly, early execution is possible when the vote is open, the support threshold
///  $$\texttt{worstCaseSupport} > \texttt{supportThreshold}$$,
///  and the minimum participation
///  $$\texttt{participation} \ge \texttt{minParticipation}$$
///  are met.
///  #### Threshold vs. Minimum
///  For threshold values, $>$ comparison is used. This **does not** include the threshold value. E.g., for $\texttt{supportThreshold} = 50\%$, the criterion is fulfilled if there is at least one more yes than no votes ($N_\text{yes} = N_\text{no}+1$).

/// @title MajorityVotingBase
/// @author Aragon Association - 2022
/// @notice The abstract implementation of majority voting plugins.
///
///  #### Parameterization
///  We define two parameters
///  $$\texttt{support} = \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}}$$
///  and
///  $$\texttt{participation} = \frac{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain}}{N_\text{total}}$$
///  where $N_\text{yes}$, $N_\text{no}$, and $N_\text{abstain}$ are the yes, no, and abstain votes that have been casted and $N_\text{total}$ is the total voting power available at proposal creation time.
///  Majority voting implies that the support threshold is set with
///  $$\texttt{supportThreshold} \ge 50\% .$$
///  However, this is not enforced by the contract code and developers can make unsafe parameterss and only the frontend will warn about bad parameter settings.
///
///  #### Vote Replacement Execution
///  The contract allows votes to be replaced. Voters can vote multiple times and only the latest voteOption is tallied.
///
///  #### Early Execution
///  This contract allows a proposal to be executed early, iff the vote outcome cannot change anymore by more people voting. Accordingly, vote replacement and early execution are mutually exclusive options.
///  $$\texttt{remainingVotes} = N_\text{total}-\underbrace{(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})}_{\text{turnout}}$$
///  We use this quantity to calculate the worst case support that would be obtained if all remaining votes are casted with no:
///  $$\begin{align*}
///    \texttt{worstCaseSupport}
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+(N_\text{no} + \texttt{remainingVotes})}
///    \\[3mm]
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no} + N_\text{total}-(N_\text{yes}+N_\text{no}+N_\text{abstain})}
///    \\[3mm]
///    &= \frac{N_\text{yes}}{ N_\text{total}-N_\text{abstain}}
///  \end{align*}$$
///  Accordingly, early execution is possible when the vote is open, the support threshold
///  $$\texttt{worstCaseSupport} > \texttt{supportThreshold}$$,
///  and the minimum participation
///  $$\texttt{participation} \ge \texttt{minParticipation}$$
///  are met.
///  #### Threshold vs. Minimum
///  For threshold values, $>$ comparison is used. This **does not** include the threshold value. E.g., for $\texttt{supportThreshold} = 50\%$, the criterion is fulfilled if there is at least one more yes than no votes ($N_\text{yes} = N_\text{no}+1$).
///  For minimal values, $\ge$ comparison is used. This **does** include the minimum participation value. E.g., for $\texttt{minParticipation} = 40\%$ and $N_\text{total} = 10$, the criterion is fulfilled if 4 out of 10 votes were casted.
