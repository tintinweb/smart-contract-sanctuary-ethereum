     * The relayers should prefer lower `acceptanceBudget`, as it improves their chances of being compensated.
     * From a Relay's point of view, this is the highest gas value a bad Paymaster may cost the relay,
     * since the paymaster will pay anything above that value regardless of whether the transaction succeeds or reverts.
     * Specifying value too high might make the call rejected by relayers (see `maxAcceptanceBudget` in server config).

     * ##### `preRelayedCallGasLimit`
     * The max gas usage of preRelayedCall. Any revert of the `preRelayedCall` is a request rejection by the paymaster.
     * As long as `acceptanceBudget` is above `preRelayedCallGasLimit`, any such revert is not payed by the paymaster.
     *
     * ##### `postRelayedCallGasLimit`
