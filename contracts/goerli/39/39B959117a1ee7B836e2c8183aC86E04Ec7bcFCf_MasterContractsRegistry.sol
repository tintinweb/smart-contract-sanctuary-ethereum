/**
 *  @notice The ContractsRegistry module
 *
 *  The purpose of this module is to provide an organized registry of the project's smartcontracts
 *  together with the upgradeability and dependency injection mechanisms.
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry should be used as the highest level smartcontract that is aware of any other
 *  contract present in the system. The contracts that demand other system's contracts would then inherit
 *  special `AbstractDependant` contract and override `setDependencies()` function to enable ContractsRegistry
 *  to inject dependencies into them.
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry will help with the following usecases:
 *
 *  1) Making the system upgradeable
 *  2) Making the system contracts-interchangeable
 *  3) Simplifying the contracts management and deployment
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry acts as a Transparent proxy deployer. One can add proxy-compatible implementations to the registry
 *  and deploy proxies to them. Then these proxies can be upgraded easily using the ContractsRegistry.
 *  The ContractsRegistry itself can be deployed behind a proxy as well.
 *
 *  The dependency injection system may come in handy when one wants to substitute a contract `A` with a contract `B`
 *  (for example contract `A` got exploited) without a necessity of redeploying the whole system. One would just add
 *  a new `B` contract to a ContractsRegistry and re-inject all the required dependencies. Dependency injection mechanism
 *  also works with factories.
 *
 *  The management is simplified because all of the contracts are now located in a single place.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

 *
 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector

 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two

 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if

 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the
 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says
 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".
 *
 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing
 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due
 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.
