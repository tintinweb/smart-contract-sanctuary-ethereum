/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

  * @dev    Time-Weighted Average Balance Library for ERC20 tokens.
  * @notice This TwabLib adds on-chain historical lookups to a user(s) time-weighted average balance.
            Each user is mapped to an Account struct containing the TWAB history (ring buffer) and
            ring buffer parameters. Every token.transfer() creates a new TWAB checkpoint. The new TWAB
            checkpoint is stored in the circular ring buffer, as either a new checkpoint or rewriting
            a previous checkpoint with new parameters. The TwabLib (using existing blocktimes of 1block/15sec)
            guarantees minimum 7.4 years of search history.

                of accurate historical lookups with current estimates of 1 new block
                every 15 seconds - assuming each block contains a transfer to trigger an

                the max cardinality variable. Preventing "corrupted" ring buffer lookup
                pointers and new observation checkpoints.

/**
 * @title Abstract ownable contract that can be inherited by other contracts
 * @notice Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, where
 * there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to
 * specific functions.
 *
 * The `owner` is first set by passing the address of the `initialOwner` to the Ownable Initialize.
 *
 * The owner account can be transferred through a two steps process:
 *      1. The current `owner` calls {transferOwnership} to set a `pendingOwner`
 *      2. The `pendingOwner` calls {claimOwnership} to accept the ownership transfer
 *
 * This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier
 * `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the owner.
