     * [IMPORTANT]

     * You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!

     * Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets
     * like Gnosis Safe, and does not provide security since it can be circumvented by calling from a contract
     * constructor.
