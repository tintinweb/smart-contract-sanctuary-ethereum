    You can deposit CLAY (ERC20 token native to Sumero) to get zCLAY Bonds (a new ERC20 representing the bond).

    These zCLAY Bonds can be minted upto a year from depositStartDate.
    The bonds will mature after a period of 3 years from the depositStartDate.

    There is a "Fixed APY" (Annual Percentage Yield) of 40% on the zCLAY Bonds and a "Bonus APY" of additional 20% that is constantly decreasing as the deposit close date is nearing (i.e. from a maximum of 20% to 0%).
    In total giving a maximum of 60% APY if a user creates bonds at Day 1 of bond start date.

    - FIXED_APY = 40%
    - BONUS_APY = 20% (decreases as deposit close date nears)

    Example:

    - User deposits 1 Clay and issues a zCLAY Bond on Day 1 of bond start date
    - [(deposit close timestamp - block timestamp) / (1 year in seconds) * Bonus_APY]
    - Total APY = APY + Bonus APY = 60%
    - User get 2.8 zCLAY Bond (Total APY (60%) for next 3 years i.e 180% total interest)
    - 1 + (180% of 1) => 1 + 1.8 => 2.8
    
    The user can claim the zCLAY Bonds for equivalent value of CLAY after the maturation date.
