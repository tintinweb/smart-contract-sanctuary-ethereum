/**
 * @title Filtered Minter contract that allows tokens to be minted with ETH
 * when purchaser owns an allowlisted ERC-721 NFT. This contract does NOT track
 * if a purchaser has/has not minted already -- it simply restricts purchasing
 * to anybody that holds one or more of a specified list of ERC-721 NFTs.
 * This is designed to be used with IGenArt721CoreContractV3 contracts.
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice Privileged Roles and Ownership:
 * This contract is designed to be managed, with limited powers.
 * Privileged roles and abilities are controlled by the core contract's Admin
 * ACL contract and a project's artist. Both of these roles hold extensive
 * power and can modify minter details.
 * Care must be taken to ensure that the admin ACL contract and artist
 * addresses are secure behind a multi-sig or other access control mechanism.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to the core contract's Admin ACL
 * contract:
 * - registerNFTAddress
 * - unregisterNFTAddress
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist:
 * - allowHoldersOfProjects
 * - removeHoldersOfProjects
 * - allowRemoveHoldersOfProjects
 * - updatePricePerTokenInWei
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional admin and artist privileged roles may be described on other
 * contracts that this minter integrates with.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This contract allows gated minting with support for vaults to delegate minting
 * privileges via an external delegation registry. This means a vault holding an
 * allowed token can delegate minting privileges to a wallet that is not holding an
 * allowed token, enabling the vault to remain air-gapped while still allowing minting.
 * The delegation registry contract is responsible for managing these delegations,
 * and is available at the address returned by the public immutable
 * `delegationRegistryAddress`. At the time of writing, the delegation
 * registry enables easy delegation configuring at https://delegate.cash/.
 * Art Blocks does not guarentee the security of the delegation registry, and
 * users should take care to ensure that the delegation registry is secure.
 * Delegations must be configured by the vault owner prior to purchase. Supported
 * delegation types include token-level, contract-level (via genArt721CoreAddress), or
 * wallet-level delegation. Contract-level delegations must be configured for the core
 * token contract as returned by the public immutable variable `genArt721CoreAddress`.
