/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

 * Flow from transfer from polygon to optimism:

 * 3. The swapped assets will get burned
 * 4. The Connext contract will call `dispatch` on the messaging contract to add the transfer
 *    to the root
 * 5. [At some time interval] Relayers call `send` to send the current root from polygon to
 *    mainnet. This is done on all "spoke" domains.
 * 6. [At some time interval] Relayers call `propagate` [better name] on mainnet, this generates a new merkle
 *    root from all of the AMBs
 *    - This function must be able to read root data from all AMBs and aggregate them into a single merkle
 *      tree root
 *    - Will send the mixed root from all chains back through the respective AMBs to all other chains
 * 7. AMB will call `update` to update the latest root on the messaging contract on spoke domains
 * 8. [At any point] Relayers can call `proveAndProcess` to prove inclusion of dispatched message, and call
 *    process on the `Connext` contract
 * 9. Takes minted bridge tokens and credits the LP
 *
 * AMB requirements:
 * - Access `msg.sender` both from mainnet -> spoke and vice versa
 * - Ability to read *our root* from the AMB
 *

 * - PoS bridge from polygon
 * - arbitrum bridge
 * - optimism bridge
 * - gnosis chain
