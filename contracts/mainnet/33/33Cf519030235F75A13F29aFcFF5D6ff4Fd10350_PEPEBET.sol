 * 🐸 PEPE.BET & PEPE.CASINO - Your WEB3 Social Gambling Platform
 *
 * PEPEBET offers a user-friendly, transparent, and fun betting/gaming platform where we focus on the needs of our community. 
 * We offer market-leading features, no house cuts for token holders, and staking as well to those who want to passively earn and be a part of the PEPE ecosystem.
 * If you have a large community or friends with similar interests, you can set up your own tipster competition and earn the house cut yourself! 
 * If you prefer yields, you can stake your PEPEBET tokens, because we are sharing 50% of the house income with our holders.
 * You can bet on our platform using ETH and PEPEBET as well! The main difference, however, is that when you are wagering with our token, NO HOUSE FEE will be deducted. 
 * Do you want to play using ETH but want to lower the fees? 🔥 Hold & burn PEPEBET on your account to decrease the ETH house tax by 50%. 
 *
 * Total Supply: 1.000.000.000 PEPEBET
 * Circulating Supply: 777.777.777 PEPEBET (rest burned before launch)
 * Max Wallet: 2%
 * Max TX: 1%
 * Initial Taxes: 5-7%
 * Launch Pair & LP size: 3000 USDC
 * Intitial LP Lock: 2 months

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
