Vixin Net
AI-driven Influencer Marketing Platform

In essence, influencer marketing is a sort of social media marketing that relies on endorsements and product recommendations from influencers– persons who have a large social following and are widely regarded as experts in their respective fields. It makes use of an existing influencer's reach in order to promote your brand, advocate your product, or co-create content with the goal of increasing brand recognition and driving sales.

Influencer marketing is primarily focused on using the following of industry leaders to drive development in any brand. The allure of influencer marketing is that the audience is already in place; all that is required is the establishment of a win-win collaboration in which both sides are providing incredible value to their respective audiences.

Nonetheless, influencer marketing is effective because of the high level of trust that social influencers have established with their followers, and their endorsements act as a sort of social proof to your brand's prospective consumers.

We wish to assist small and medium-sized enterprises and brands in identifying the most appropriate collection of influencers across the industry to market their products or services to the most appropriate clients at the most reasonable price.

VixinVPN | Global VPN Service


As more and more of our information flow online and new vulnerabilities are revealed on a daily basis, privacy has long been a source of worry in networking.This network allows users to create decentralized virtual private networks (VPNs) by purchasing bandwidth from a worldwide pool of service providers.

VixinVPN's purpose is to provide users with the ability to understand and manage the network activity of their own computers, free of fear of censorship, monitoring, or third-party intervention. With that objective as a guideline, we're developing solutions for a broad range of users by leveraging open source software to establish a decentralized VPN market driven by probabilistic nanopayments on the Binance blockchain.

Our architecture emphasizes scalability, decentralization, usability, simplicity, and flexibility, among other characteristics. Currently, VixinVPN has several restrictions that are inherited from Ethereum, including payment anonymity, scalability, and censorship resistance, among other things. Moreover, VixinVPN's capacity to fight against the most powerful theoretical traffic analysis assaults is still limited by our initial emphasis on economical high bandwidth, low latency routing. Despite these constraints, the majority of our principal envisioned mass consumer use cases do not pose a problem.

VixinVPN does this via the use of our ERC-20 token, VINI, a novel VPN protocol for token-incentivized bandwidth proxying, and smart contracts with algorithmic advertising and payment features. VixinVPN's customers connect to bandwidth sellers via a provider listing, and they pay using probabilistic nano payments, resulting in acceptable Ethereum transaction costs on packets.

VixinBox | Smart and secure hardware wallet

Blockchain technology is dependent on hardware wallets, which are critical components of the ecosystem. When working with blockchains, they give both security and functionality. Even if the computer you're using is not secure, a hardware wallet can keep your money safe. Using a hardware wallet provides an additional degree of security against cyber assaults, phishing websites, and viruses.

In addition to robust security features like multi-signature and passphrase protection, VixinBox is now available as an open- source hardware wallet that is decentralized and offline.

A variety of sophisticated security measures, including a self-destruct mechanism, will be included in VixinBox. An air-gapped signature method has also been included. Using the VixinBox App, which was designed to be user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices, users can link with and manage their VixinBox accounts.

As the hardware device operates totally offline, it is immune to online and remote attack vectors, a trait that is referred to as "air- gapped" in the industry. The "VixinBox" is a next-generation hardware wallet that is resistant to online and remote attack vectors. A one-way QR code allows the gadget to communicate with itself in an offline environment.

Furthermore, the VixinBox has been designed from the ground up in close collaboration with world-renowned experts in chip manufacturing, applied industrial cryptography, and hardware security to physically tamper-proof the device, taking into consideration any known attack vectors of current hardware wallet solutions, and also emerging security risks that have not yet been documented in detail.

Stainless steel plates of the highest grade are used to create an eternal, encrypted (private or mnemonic phrase) key backup system. This second product represents at least a two-fold advancement in terms of technological progress. Water spills and corrosion, as well as shocks and other extreme circumstances, are all resistant to this material's durability and toughness. The first recoverable backup, which means that the user may now safely restore a backup of his backup, has also been created.

VixinBox will also provide a smartphone application that is available for download. One-way QR codes allow the app to connect with the hardware wallet, so it has the capability of gaining access to a list of all public accounts made on the VixinBox and downloading the relevant real-time data straight from the blockchain. The VixinBox may also accept and originate transactions, which can be signed by the VixinBox in an air-gapped, offline manner using QR codes. In no case does the mobile app have access to confidential data such as the private key(s). 

VixinLook  | A decentralized social media platform

Nowadays, the blockchain sector is characterized by extraordinary levels of innovation. However, since most of these advances are focused on short-term gain, they do not give a compelling rationale for individuals to switch from centralized to decentralized systems.

Early in the twenty-first century, the internet was in a similar condition, with a lot of promise but little actual benefit. Various problems, including lack of official recognition, a lack of knowledge of the technology, and high-risk considerations, are cited as reasons for the lack of widespread acceptance.

Blockchain technology has given rise to a new generation of social networks that have the potential to be much larger and better. Nevertheless, the old social models are given superpowers by these new networks In the Vixin Infinity Ecosystem, data frauds, misinformed algorithm modifications, and needless content filtering might become a thing of the past.

This is since all of our digital platforms, including our social media network, are owned and operated by community members. VixinLook represents a digital social media marketplace that is decentralized, safe, open, and community-run. It is committed to the growth, development, and acceptance of our social media network in a manner that is chosen by the community itself.

In contrast to centralized social networking platforms, federated networks promote independence by removing the need for a central authority from the equation. Censorship resistance, ownership of personal data, and enhanced control over user- generated content are just a few of the advantages of this novel type of social networking platform.

Users have greater control and autonomy while using decentralized social networks. A person may create their own social network and decide how it will run and what people will be able to say on it. A decentralized social network's creator may develop guidelines for acceptable conduct on the site, rather than relying on a business to regulate material on the premises.

VixinLook has several benefits over standard social media networks, including the following:

Data Privacy
Decentralized Ownership
Shared Profit Model
Freedom Of Speech

Furthermore, VixinLook also provides the option of using social financing in conjunction with this (SocialFi). Social influence on social networks is tokenized via the VINI token, which allows users to get direct monetary advantages as a result of their position as prominent personalities on our platform.

Listed below are the primary issues that conventional social networks face, and which SocialFi hopes to address:

1. Assignment of data rights: Social media platforms acquire and store as much user data as legally can throughout their platform networks and from third parties, all of which becomes their property once it has been collected and stored. Users' data will be collected in a transparent and unspoofable manner, according to SocialFi's goal of using blockchain technology.

2. Benefits Distribution: In general, social media networks generate money by selling advertisements to users depending on the amount of traffic they receive on their platforms. A larger amount of traffic and interaction benefits the platform, resulting in billions of dollars in ad income, while consumers only gain from their participation in it. the ability to exert influence and make use of

3.Privacy and security: In a standard social network, any account registration necessitates the storage of the user's information in the program, such as their mobile phone number, email address, and so on. a backend that is vulnerable to leakage on behalf of the operator It is built on blockchain technology, and the anonymous character of user-identifying data aids in the protection of privacy and security.

VixinLook's inception and integration with SocialFi are unquestionably one of the most exemplary applications of blockchain technology t o date, and it has the potential to be at the forefront of widespread adoption throughout the world.

Social media networks have worldwide appeal, and when new technologies like SocialFi facilitated through the VINI token and decentralization enter the picture, VixinLook might be the key to enabling widespread adoption of social media networks.

VixinMail  | A decentralized email service platform

Users are reporting security breaches practically every day, prompting many to install extra protection software or switch to a different email client - a worrying trend. It has been estimated that over $26 billion has been lost globally as a consequence of cyberattacks carried out over email in only the previous two years.

When it comes to email security, traditional methods such as the most up-to-date antivirus software will never be able to prevent cyber-attacks, particularly sophisticated social engineering attempts. Email security vulnerabilities are increasing at an alarming rate nowadays, and it's hard to keep up. Malware assaults such as spear-phishing, whale phishing (also known as whaling), ransomware, and other types of malware have become a significant source of concern for many individuals and enterprises.

The following are some of the issues that consumers have with present email providers:

Lack of encryption
Centralized governance
Insecurity
Lack of privacy

Additionally, the use of blockchain technology in the email services may improve security and efficiency in the process; in addition, since it is an automated system, it cannot be exploited or tampered with. It will highlight the user account's security and privacy, and secrecy.

Its primary goal is to provide a decentralized email solution platform that is dedicated to protecting the digital rights of email users and combating email assaults in a decentralized manner.

VixinMail is an immutable, totally private, absolutely secure, fully configurable, and cost-effective email service that will soon make the traditional methods of delivering email services redundant.

VixinMail has the following characteristics:

Blockchain security
Secure decentralization
Cryptographic encryption
Revolutionary and immutable 
technological protocol

In order to access the VixinMail platform's many services, VINI is used as a utility payment token.

VixinLiv | An open-source online news and media platform

Open-source software constitutes a software for which the original source code has been made publicly accessible and which may then be redistributed and updated to meet the specific needs of the individual who has downloaded it. It is a decentralized software development approach that promotes open cooperation and supports the use of free and open-source technologies. One of the essential tenets of open-source software development is peer production, which means that goods such as source code, designs, and documentation are made freely accessible to the general public.

Because of growing public skepticism about news media worldwide, coupled with the development of more robust and accessible digital tools, journalists and media outlets have begun to engage in a more proactive manner in open-source journalism-a practice in which reporters investigate and construct stories using publicly available data, including information obtained through social media.

A decentralized and democratic online news network and media platform, VixinLiv was launched in 2022 by the Vixin Infinity Ecosystem and is intended to increase the impact of journalism code and the community of developers, designers, journalists, and editors who create it. VixinLiv is an open-source project created by the Vixin Infinity Ecosystem.

In the opinion of VixinLiv, a community of peers working together, learning from one another, and addressing challenges may help to build a better and more responsive media environment overall.

When compared to conventional media platforms, the following are the advantages of VixinLiv:

Trust and transparency
Authentic content
Cost-effectiveness
More secure
Community driven

To encourage users to collaborate and create content on our site, we will be using VINI, our Ecosystem token. The VINI token, which has a minimal transaction fee, would be used as a payment option for our various media items, which would be available on the Ethereum blockchain.

VixinSwap | A First Mover DEX constructed on the Ethereum Blockchain

Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges retain insufficient and unsound security for the crypto assets they hold. Security problems resulting in client asset loss occur more often than people realize, as a consequence of internal theft or embezzlement. Overall, the lack of trust, transparency, privacy, security, and a high degree of risk are the most significant challenges and disadvantages of a centralized exchange, resulting in the rise of decentralized exchanges (DEX). When it comes to blockchain technology, decentralization is one of the most fundamental elements to comprehend. Decentralization, in which transactions occur without a central third-party intermediary such as a bank or financial organization, redistributes power from a small number of people to a large number of people. A large number of traditional financial services are being reengineered as a result of this transformation.

Because users are not required to transmit their assets to an exchange, decentralized exchanges may help decrease the danger of theft and loss of cash due to hacking attacks on computers. Due to the absence of Know Your Customer (KYC) cryptocurrency laws and regulations, DEXs may also help to avoid price manipulation and phantom trade volume, while simultaneously allowing users to keep a certain level of anonymity.

Users may trade novel and obscure cryptocurrencies that were previously impossible to swap elsewhere, either on the DEX itself or via a DApp (decentralized application) that was developed in collaboration with the DEX. Generally,

centralized exchanges only endorse a dozen or so projects, and the vast majority of them only endorse the most popular cryptocurrencies, making it more challenging to trade smaller and less popular tokens, particularly because centralized exchanges constrain users from other countries from participating.

DEXs are trustless, which means that users' cash, privacy, and restricted personal data are all protected to the greatest extent possible. A DEX allows users to access it quickly and securely without registering an account on the DEX, going through identity verification, or disclosing personal information.

Despite the fact that the advent of DEX is a very positive development for cryptocurrency users, various challenges remain, as platforms and blockchains continue to strive to deliver the best possible user experience in terms of cost, scalability, usability, and dependability.

In order to address and resolve all of the aforementioned difficulties, VixinSwap has been designed as a DEX.

VixinSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform based on the Ethereum Blockchain that promises to solve existing challenges in the blockchain community and push trade to new heights. The platform is currently in beta and is expected to launch soon.

Whereas other blockchains face challenges with issues such as scalability, adoption, and performance, VixinSwap, which is constructed on the Ethereum, not just pledges to offer a more resilient user experience, but it also provides infinitely more scalable solutions, allowing its users to have a seamless and astounding experience.

VixinSwap would function as a digital asset exchange, allowing traders to instantaneously swap their digital assets without the need to open an account or go through a time-consuming and complex KYC procedure. VixinSwap also protects the privacy of its customers by providing non-custodial trading services, allowing our consumers to retain total control over their digital assets.

Aside from that, the low transaction costs on VixinSwap enable dealers to keep a greater portion of the digital assets they obtain as a result of their trade. As an added bonus, VixinSwap users may join in liquidity pools, in which they will get LP tokens proportional to their contribution, allowing them to partake in the fees. They just need to make a deposit of ETH or VINI. Users may also earn VINI by simply putting their LP tokens into a smart contract and running the contract. This provides users with an incentive to handle the risk of temporary losses that is inherent in providing liquidity on a DEX.

Users also have the possibility of staking their tokens, which is a more convenient manner of increasing the value of their tokens. The primary benefits of cryptocurrency staking are passive income and the low barrier to entry. Staking may be quick and straightforward if you utilize a staking pool or an online tool to execute it. Additionally, it is far more energy-efficient than mining and significantly less dangerous than trading.

What does VixinSwap offer?

Even though VixinSwap is a DEX, it provides a plethora of benefits that are doing more than simply facilitating trades between digital assets. We offer the following services that are aimed to help users to earn and grow:

1- Decentralized exchange
2- Yield farming
3- Staking
4- Lotteries
