/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();
 * }
 * ```

/*
 * @title String & slice utility library for Solidity contracts.
 * @author Nick Johnson <[email protected]>
 *
 * @dev Functionality in this library is largely implemented using an
 *      abstraction called a 'slice'. A slice represents a part of a string -
 *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no
 *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify
 *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less
 *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.
 *
 *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return
 *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for
 *      instance, `s.split(".")` will return the text up to the first '.',
 *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.
 *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you
 *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:
 *      `s.copy().split(".")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since
 *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many
 *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.
 *
 *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating
 *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in
 *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second
 *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.
 *
 *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than
 *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if
 *      required.
 *
 *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying
 *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,
 *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values
 *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.
