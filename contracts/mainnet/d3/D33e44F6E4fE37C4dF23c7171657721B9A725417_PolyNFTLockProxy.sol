/**
 * @dev Wrappers over encoding and serialization operation into bytes from bassic types in Solidity for PolyNetwork cross chain utility.
 *
 * Encode basic types in Solidity into bytes easily. It's designed to be used 
 * for PolyNetwork cross chain application, and the encoding rules on Ethereum chain 
 * and the decoding rules on other chains should be consistent. Here we  
 * follow the underlying serialization rule with implementation found here: 
 * https://github.com/polynetwork/poly/blob/master/common/zero_copy_sink.go
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked serialization method can help reduce
 * the risk of serious bugs and handfule, so it's recommended to use it.
 *
 * Please note that risk can be minimized, yet not eliminated.
