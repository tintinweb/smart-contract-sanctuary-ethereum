 * @title The LinkAvailableBalanceMonitor contract.

 * function linkAvailableForPayment() and funds them with LINK if it falls below a defined
 * threshold. Also supports aggregator proxy contracts monitoring which require fetching the actual
 * target contract through a predefined interface.
 * @dev with 30 addresses as the MAX_PERFORM, the measured max gas usage of performUpkeep is around 2M
 * therefore, we recommend an upkeep gas limit of 3M (this has a 33% margin of safety). Although, nothing
 * prevents us from using 5M gas and increasing MAX_PERFORM, 30 seems like a reasonable batch size that
 * is probably plenty for most needs.
 * @dev with 130 addresses as the MAX_CHECK, the measured max gas usage of checkUpkeep is around 3.5M,
 * which is 30% below the 5M limit.
 * Note that testing conditions DO NOT match live chain gas usage, hence the margins. Change
 * at your own risk!!!
 * @dev some areas for improvement / acknowledgement of limitations:
 * * validate that all addresses conform to interface when adding them to the watchlist
 * * this is a "trusless" upkeep, meaning it does not trust the caller of performUpkeep;
     we could save a fair amount of gas and re-write this upkeep for use with Automation v2.0+,
     which has significantly different trust assumptions
