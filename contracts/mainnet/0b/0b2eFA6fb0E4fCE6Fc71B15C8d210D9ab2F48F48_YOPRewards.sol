/// @notice This contract will be used to calculate the YOP rewards for vault and staking users based on the emission schedule outlined in YOP tokenomics.
///  In a nutshell, from Jan 2022, there will be certain amount of YOP token distributed to all users who provide liquidity to vaults or stake their YOP tokens.
///  The emission will last for 10 years, and the amount of first month is 342554 and will reduce by 1% every month.
///  Initially the split will be 50-50 between users who provide liquidity to vaults and users who stake. However, the value is configurable and may change down the road.
///  Each vault also has a weight to decide the proportion of the overall vault emission it will get.
///  For vaults, the rewards are associated with users, so they can still claim unclaimed rewards after they transfer their vault tokens to others.
///  However, for Staking, the staking rewards is associated with each stake, as each stake is unique and there is an NFT associated with each stake.
///  This means that if there is unclaimed rewards, and then the NFT is transferred, the new owner will be able to claim all unclaimed rewards too.
/// @dev Given the token emission rate for a vault R, and from time T1 to time T2, user balance U and total balance of the vault V, the rewards for the user can be calculated as:
///       (T2 - T1) * R * (U/V)
///      So to calculate the total rewards for a user, we just need to calculate the value above everytime when R, U, V is about to change, from the last time any of these value chaged,
///      and add them up over time.
///      The above equation can also be written as (T2 - T1) * R / V * U. So when U is not changed, we can calculate the sum of `(T2 - T1) * R / V` part and store it. And then multiply the U when U is about to change.
///      And this is how we do it in this contract.

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
