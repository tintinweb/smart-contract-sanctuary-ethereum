Are you tired of being a bitch and flipping burgers on your wagey?! Join us at KFG where you will make fat tendies while we meme ourselves to an mcap our lord and savior Andrew Tate aka Trigger Don aka TopG would be proud of. 

Our aim is to have fun and become one of the biggest shitcoins which ever listed on uniswap. Besides from the shitty rugpulls and crap but fuck those. At KFG you are safe, with an renounced contract and the LP burned so it is either do or die baby!  

But this comes at a cost, for every mad stack of profits you rake in you have to pay a fee of 5% when selling when the fucking paperhands who sell at a loss like a true wagecuck don’t have a sell fee at all.

The marketing funds ahum the bugatti funds in case of we moon to like billion dollar mcap and there is millions in the bugatti fund we either buy a bugatti or buy and apply for Binance for all we care. 

So..... now is your time.... are you a fucking wagey or a Trigger happy mofo ready to hail to the lord and savior... ANDREW FUCKING TATE!
