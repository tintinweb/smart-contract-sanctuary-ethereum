/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:

 * @author Non-Fungible Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * This contract can be used for verifying complex signature-encoded
 * bundle descriptions. This resolves on a new array of SignatureItems[],
 * which outside of verification, is passed around as bytes memory.
 *
 * Each SignatureItem has four fields:
 *      - cType (collateral Type)
 *      - asset (contract address of the asset)
 *      - tokenId (token ID of the asset, if applicable)
 *      - amount (amount of the asset, if applicable)
 *
 * - For token ids part of ERC721, other features beyond direct tokenIds are supported:
 *      - A provided token id of -1 is a wildcard, meaning any token ID is accepted.
 *      - Wildcard token ids are not supported for ERC1155.
 * - All amounts are taken as minimums. For instance, if the "amount" field of an ERC1155 is 5,
 *      then a bundle with 8 of those ERC1155s are accepted.
 * - For an ERC20 cType, tokenId is ignored. For an ERC721 cType, amount is ignored.
 *
 * - Any deviation from the above rules represents an unparseable signature and will always
 *      return invalid.
 *
 * - All multi-item signatures assume AND - any optional expressed by OR
 *      can be implemented by simply signing multiple separate signatures.

 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.
