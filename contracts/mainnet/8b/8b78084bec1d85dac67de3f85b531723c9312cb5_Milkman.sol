Then, an off-chain server creates a CoW order on behalf of the clone, and encodes in that order's `signature` data used to generate the order. The clone does checks, including calling a user-provided `priceChecker` (which could for example check SushiSwap to see if what they could get out of SushiSwap was at least 90% of the order's `minOut`), and if everything looks good it returns true, which allows the swap to go through.
