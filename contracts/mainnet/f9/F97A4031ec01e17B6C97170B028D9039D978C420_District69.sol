District 69 is a meme project created on the Ethereum blockchain. District 69 features on Amazon’s women. After the destruction of their planet, some of them managed to land on planet Earth. Eventually, they discovered that most of their superpowers were gone and life on Earth was way too harsh to bear. In order to survive, they established District 69 on abandoned land and started prostitution. As mentioned above, not all their superpowers are gone and from dawn-to-dusk they fight against injustice, criminality and human rights.
