/* Mythic Gateways and the Mythic Journey [an overview]

   Turn-based RPG which does at least the following:

   1. Requires a Liquid Key to open a Mythic Gateway.
      The Liquid Key must be added to the Mythic Gateway contract.

   2. Requires the user to select an NFT from one of the pre-approved contracts,
      such as Liquid Legends, Liquid Invaders, Azuki Ape Social Club, or
      Typical Tigers.

      a) If a Typical Tiger is selected, also requires a Baby Cub Tiger
         to be permanently stored inside the contract

      - Writes the Token ID of the Liquid Key + the contract of the NFT
        being used along with the Token ID of the NFT being used.

   3. Requires a Mythic Artifact to be burned during the initial setup
      of the Mythic Gateway.

   4. We use the ETH blockrate to determine how many points are gained during
      the time the gateway is open (the NFT is on a "Journey"). Points accrue
      at a specific rate per Journey.

   5. During the Journey, the NFT randomly accumulates items, which are dynamic,
      based on a list of contracts (also dynamic) and periodically the user can
      interact with the contract and claim any item which was randomly
      acquired on the Journey.

   *  Other stuff is proprietary, so... go fack.
