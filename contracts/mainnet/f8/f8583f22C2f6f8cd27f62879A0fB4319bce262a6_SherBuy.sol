 *   set in `requestPrice`, which has an expanded input set.
 * - settleAndGetPrice: Replaced by `settle`, which can only be called once per settleable request. The resolved price
 *   can be fetched via the `Settle` event or the return value of `settle`.
 * - general changes to interface: Functions that interact with existing requests all require the parameters of the
 *   request to modify to be passed as input. These parameters must match with the existing request parameters or the
 *   function will revert. This change reflects the internal refactor to store hashed request parameters instead of the
 *   full request struct.
