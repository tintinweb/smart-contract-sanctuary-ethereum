/*
 * @title String & slice utility library for Solidity contracts.
 * @author Nick Johnson <[email protected]>
 *
 * @dev Functionality in this library is largely implemented using an
 *      abstraction called a 'slice'. A slice represents a part of a string -
 *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no
 *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify
 *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less
 *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.
 *
 *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return
 *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for
 *      instance, `s.split(".")` will return the text up to the first '.',
 *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.
 *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you
 *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:
 *      `s.copy().split(".")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since
 *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many
 *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.
 *
 *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating
 *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in
 *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second
 *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.
 *
 *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than
 *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if
 *      required.
 *
 *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying
 *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,
 *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values
 *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.
