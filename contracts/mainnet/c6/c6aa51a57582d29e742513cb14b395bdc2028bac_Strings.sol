A divination nft, a total of 3591. Hexagram, which is the result of divination, is generated on the chain. It is a divination for nft holders, which can be divination once a day. Its idea comes from the Book of Changes, which simulates the divination logic of the real world.(time,space,people)
How does it work?
1. Enter an unclaimed tokenID and claim nft
2. Read your own hexagram, use the tokenURL function, and enter your tokenID.
3. The hexagrams are composed of inner hexagrams and outer hexagrams. The purple hexagrams are inner hexagrams, and the red hexagrams are outer hexagrams. If there is only one purple or red, the inner and outer hexagrams are the same. This hexagram is the original hexagram.
4. Each hexagram has 6 lines, and each line is called Yao. Its position is from bottom to top: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
5. If there are numbers on the image, it means that there is hexagram of change, and the number corresponds to the position of the change yao. With numbers and original hexagrams, you can find out  hexagram of change.
6. You can try to solve the hexagram yourself.
