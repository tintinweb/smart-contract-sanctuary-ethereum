  @member percent The percent of the whole group that this split occupies. This number is out of `JBConstants.SPLITS_TOTAL_PERCENT`.
  @member projectId The ID of a project. If an allocator is not set but a projectId is set, funds will be sent to the protocol treasury belonging to the project who's ID is specified. Resulting tokens will be routed to the beneficiary with the claimed token preference respected.
  @member beneficiary An address. The role the of the beneficary depends on whether or not projectId is specified, and whether or not an allocator is specified. If allocator is set, the beneficiary will be forwarded to the allocator for it to use. If allocator is not set but projectId is set, the beneficiary is the address to which the project's tokens will be sent that result from a payment to it.
