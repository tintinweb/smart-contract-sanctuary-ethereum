/**
* @title PaymentSplitter
* @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
* that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.
*
* The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
* account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
* an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the
* time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.
*
* `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
* accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
* function.
*
* NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and
* tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you
* to run tests before sending real value to this contract.
