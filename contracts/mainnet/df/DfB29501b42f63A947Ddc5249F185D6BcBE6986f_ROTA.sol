 *         any point. As implemented, this abstract contract allows the contract owner to permanently skip the
 *         OperatorFilterRegistry checks by calling revokeOperatorFilterRegistry. Once done, the registry
 *         address cannot be further updated.
 *         Note that OpenSea will still disable creator earnings enforcement if filtered operators begin fulfilling orders
 *         on-chain, eg, if the registry is revoked or bypassed.

 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the
 * time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.
 *
 * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
 * function.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and
 * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you
 * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.
