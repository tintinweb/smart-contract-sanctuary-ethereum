 * https://github.com/orbs-network/twap
 *
 * This smart contract allows the incentivized execution of a TWAP order (either a Limit Order or a Market Order) on any DEX, with the possibility of partial fills.
 *
 * A TWAP order breaks a larger order down into smaller trades or "chunks", which are executed over a set period of time.
 * This is a common strategy in traditional finance but it was not previously possible to execute such trades in a decentralized manner in DeFi systems.
 *
 * In this smart contract, users (makers) create orders that wait in the contract to be filled. Once made, these orders enable an English Auction bidding war on each chunk at its time interval.
 * Anyone willing to participate can serve as a “taker” by finding the best path to fill the order for the next chunk on any DEX,
 * within the parameters set by the maker. Takers submit these paths as a bid to the contract, which selects the winner based on criteria described in detail below.
 *
 * The winning taker receives a portion of the output tokens as a reward for their effort.
 *
 * One honest taker (i.e., a taker who is willing to set the fee at the minimum amount needed to cover gas costs)
 * is enough to ensure the entire system functions effectively at spot prices.
 *
 * The contract is set to operate only up to the year 2106 (32bit timestamps), at which point it will no longer be usable.
 *
 * The TWAP Smart Contract does not hold any funds, has no owners, administrators, or other roles and is entirely immutable once deployed on an EVM blockchain.
