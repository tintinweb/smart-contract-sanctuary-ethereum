/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

    "fixed192x18" -- a value represented by 192 bits, that makes 18 digits available to
    the right of the decimal point.

    The range of values that uint192 can represent is about [-1.7e20, 1.7e20].

       - the function (isGood: erc20 -> bool), implemented here by goodCollateral()
       - the function (targetPerRef: erc20 -> Fix) implemented by the Collateral plugin

       ==== Definitions ====

       We use e:IERC20 to mean any erc20 token address, and tgt:bytes32 to mean any target name

       // targetWeight(b, e) is the target-unit weight of token e in basket b
       Let targetWeight(b, e) = b.refAmt[e] * targetPerRef(e)

       // backups(tgt) is the list of sound backup tokens we plan to use for target `tgt`.
       Let backups(tgt) = config.backups[tgt].erc20s
                          .filter(isGood)
                          .takeUpTo(config.backups[tgt].max)

       Let primeWt(e) = if e in config.erc20s and isGood(e)
                        then config.targetAmts[e]
                        else 0
       Let backupWt(e) = if e in backups(tgt)
                         then unsoundPrimeWt(tgt) / len(Backups(tgt))
                         else 0
       Let unsoundPrimeWt(tgt) = sum(config.targetAmts[e]
                                     for e in config.erc20s
                                     where config.targetNames[e] == tgt and !isGood(e))

       ==== The correctness condition ====

       If unsoundPrimeWt(tgt) > 0 and len(backups(tgt)) == 0 for some tgt, then disabled' == true.
       Else, disabled' == false and targetWeight(basket', e) == primeWt(e) + backupWt(e) for all e.

       ==== Higher-level desideratum ====

       The resulting total target weights should equal the configured target weight. Formally:

       let configTargetWeight(tgt) = sum(config.targetAmts[e]
                                         for e in config.erc20s
                                         where _targetNames[e] == tgt)

       let targetWeightSum(b, tgt) = sum(targetWeight(b, e)
                                         for e in config.erc20s
                                         where _targetNames[e] == tgt)

       Given all that, if disabled' == false, then for all tgt,
           targetWeightSum(basket', tgt) == configTargetWeight(tgt)

       ==== Usual specs ====

       Then, finally, given all that, the effects of _switchBasket() are:
         basket' = _newBasket, as defined above
         nonce' = nonce + 1
         timestamp' = now
