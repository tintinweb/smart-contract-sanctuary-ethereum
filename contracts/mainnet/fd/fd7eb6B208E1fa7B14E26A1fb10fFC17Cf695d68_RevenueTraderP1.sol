/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

 *
 * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.
 * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.
 *
 * The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.
 *
 * Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:
 * ```
 * contract ERC1967 {
 *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;
 *
 *     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {
 *         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;
 *     }
 *
 *     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {
 *         require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), "ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract");
 *         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * _Available since v4.1 for `address`, `bool`, `bytes32`, and `uint256`._

    // amount possible with each trade.
    //
    // How do we know this algorithm converges?
    // Assumption: constant prices
    // Any volume traded narrows the BU band. Why:
    //   - We might increase `basketsHeld` from run-to-run, but will never decrease it
    //   - We might decrease the UoA amount of excess balances beyond `basketsHeld` from
    //       run-to-run, but will never increase it
    //   - Balances within `basketsHeld` contribute to `range.top` and `range.bottom` equally
    //   - Balances beyond `basketsHeld` float `range.top` and depress `range.bottom`
    //
    // Preconditions:
    // - ctx is correctly populated with current basketsHeld
    // - reg contains erc20 + asset arrays in same order and without duplicates
    // Trading Strategy:
    // - We will not aim to hold more than rToken.basketsNeeded() BUs
    // - No double trades: if we buy B in one trade, we won't sell B in another trade
    //       Caveat: Unless the asset we're selling is IFFY/DISABLED
    // - No trading token balances corresponding to ctx.basketsHeld
    // - The best price we might get for a trade is at the high sell price and low buy price
    // - The worst price we might get for a trade is at the low sell price and
    //     the high buy price, multiplied by ( 1 - maxTradeSlippage )
    // - In the worst-case an additional dust balance can be lost, up to minTradeVolume
    // - Given all that, we're aiming to hold as many BUs as possible using the assets we own.
    //
    // More concretely:
    // - range.top = min(rToken.basketsNeeded, basketsHeld + most baskets purchaseable)
    // - range.bottom = min(rToken.basketsNeeded, basketsHeld + least baskets purchaseable)
    //   where "least baskets purchaseable" involves trading at unfavorable prices,
    //   incurring maxTradeSlippage, and taking up to a minTradeVolume loss due to dust.
