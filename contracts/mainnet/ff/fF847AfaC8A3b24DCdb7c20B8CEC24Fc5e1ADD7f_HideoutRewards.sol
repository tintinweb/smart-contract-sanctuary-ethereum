 * available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested
 * (reentrant) calls to them.
 *
 * Note that because there is a single `nonReentrant` guard, functions marked as
 * `nonReentrant` may not call one another. This can be worked around by making
 * those functions `private`, and then adding `external` `nonReentrant` entry
 * points to them.
 *
 * TIP: If you would like to learn more about reentrancy and alternative ways
 * to protect against it, check out our blog post

 * Any token transferred to this contract will follow the vesting schedule as if they were locked from the beginning.
 * Consequently, if the vesting has already started, any amount of tokens sent to this contract will (at least partly)
