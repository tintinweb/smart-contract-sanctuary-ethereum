Bozos came about because there seems to be some sort of weird belief that web3 is going to solve all web2 problems.

holy carp man, come on, there's not many of us in web3 and we aren't miracle workers. it's not like we have jesus or someone developing the next god chain.

so anyways, we are actually going to solve a problem to benefit both web2 (the masses) and web3 (the future), the only thing is we are going to make it via web2 to help web3. let's do things the other way round for a change.

does that make sense, do we need to spell it out for you, bozo?
