/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

  AIMM is a DeFi market maker with community engagement tooling built in, anyone can create a ManagedToken using our factories
  permissionlessly onchain, and benefit from our on and offchain tooling to provide intelligent tax settings, buyback and liquidity
  functions. By deriving your project's ERC20 token from a ManagedToken, users can be sure by checking the verified Solidity code of:
   - Tax is hard coded as max 5/5.
   - Visibility of Maximum Tx Amount is surfaced
   - Check whether Maximum Tx Amount is frozen.
   - Check whether Tax is frozen.

  Using our ManagedTokenTreasury, users can be sure that the portion of Tax's raised to be part of the protocol cannot be rugged by
  project owners, as there are no functions to withdraw either ETH or ERC20 from the Treasury. Protocols have to enter, before Tax is taken
  on a sale, the portion they are taking for their project. This is hard coded to be capped at 50%.

  AIMM takes a revenue share of 1% of the Tax collected by the treasury, for future development of the protocol and maintence costs.

/*
  A Managed Token, part of the AI Managed Token Suite - AIMM.

  AIMM is a DeFi market maker with community engagement tooling built in, anyone can create a ManagedToken using our factories
  permissionlessly onchain, and benefit from our on and offchain tooling to provide intelligent tax settings, buyback and liquidity
  functions. By deriving your project's ERC20 token from a ManagedToken, users can be sure by checking the verified Solidity code of:
   - Tax is hard coded as max 5/5.
   - Visibility of Maximum Tx Amount is surfaced
   - Check whether Maximum Tx Amount is frozen.
   - Check whether Tax is frozen.

  Using our ManagedTokenTreasury, users can be sure that the portion of Tax's raised to be part of the protocol cannot be rugged by
  project owners, as there are no functions to withdraw either ETH or ERC20 from the Treasury. Protocols have to enter, before Tax is taken
  on a sale, the portion they are taking for their project. This is hard coded to be capped at 50%.

  AIMM takes a revenue share of 1% of the Tax collected by the treasury, for future development of the protocol and maintence costs.
