Abstract

The rapid development of technology has led to the penetration and wider coverage of the internet, mobile communications, and smartphones around the world. The internet has changed how (and where) people think, live, do business, and gain access to entertainment. 

This new democracy has given rise to a new class of citizens – the Creators. They are the future of entrepreneurial scaling, resulting in the formation of an entirely new economy centered around them – the Creator Economy.

Zonrix is a decentralized video platform for the young generation to share their content videos. Zonrix leverages blockchain technology to guarantee a secure environment transparent and secure payment. Zonrix provides the best environment for content creators to create multiple income streams for themselves. At the same time, Zonrix allows users to explore specific content.

Zonrix introduces its digital token for payments and revenue management for creators and audiences. These tokens give us new possibilities in the video industry. Leveraging the speed and redundancy of a decentralized, Zonrix can scale and deliver thousands of videos per second in a very decentralized manner. The smart contract on the blockchain makes Zonrix the best place where the content creator can share their passion for content. Everything is transparently done in the Zonrix smart contract.


Introduction

The constantly evolving video-commerce sector has exposed the need to find technological solutions and business models to spur an epochal paradigm shift. Such a transformation would allow content creator, their audience, and stakeholders to pursue their goals and harmoniously achieve their successes. Together with our community and partners, we create a specialized environment - a new way to listen, watch and enjoy the content.

A place where every artist can distribute their content and monetize through our platform; where users can reward the creator for their favourite kinds of content; and where precise, transparent, and automated rules enforced through blockchain technology run the ecosystem - and not a small number of influential platforms.

The largest online platform for consuming content videos, YouTube is notorious for low-paying, ad-based revenue, with minor signs of improvement. Revenue models have changed drastically as well. Video platforms use a market share revenue model. Content creators earn according to the number of views for their videos in proportion to all the pieces streamed on that platform.



Blockchain and Crypto Industry

Blockchain technologies are most basically defined as decentralized distributed ledger technologies (DLT) that record the origins of transactions on a peer-to-peer network without the involvement of any intermediaries. Technology has evolved rapidly over the decade since its development. Although blockchains are best known for their role in fostering the growth of digital currencies. Cryptocurrencies and tokens are the two dominant subclasses of digital assets relying on cryptographic methods of operation. These are intangible assets that are created, sold, and stored in digital format on the blockchain.

The cryptocurrency market is valued by the capitalization of the total volume of crypto assets and tokens issued by market participants into open circulation for sale, purchase, exchange, and use in a variety of operation scenarios.

$24T The projected size of the digital asset market by the end of 2027

16000 Crypto assets created between 2014 and 2021

300M+ Cryptocurrency users worldwide

6500 Coins traded on the market



Opportunity

The establishment of Blockchain as a standard commercial technology will remove even more barriers to markets in many countries. This will revolutionize how teenagers intake online content. Artists will accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment will be more inclusive as they can offer their services to the global unbanked segment (1.7 billion people). Of these 1.7 billion adults, two thirds own a mobile phone that can access the Zonrix platform.

Blockchain technology can also tap into new market segments, most notably the global segment of 1.1 billion smartphone users who remain unbanked and various regional markets with restrictive legislation. video platform based on smart contracts would offer an automated, secure and transparent, entertaining platform.

Zonrix is trying to create a platform that supports Blockchain in a non-distractive way so that the casual user won't notice. We charge users only after they take full advantage of the platform and enjoy its full potential.

User experience on the video side of Blockchain is too complicated for the casual content creator. Not everyone is familiar with Blockchain, and cryptocurrencies. Also, companies' high fees even before joining the platform and later on during the streams are very deterrent.


About Zonrix

Zonrix is a decentralized platform that leverages the power of blockchain technology in empowering content creators on how their content is delivered to a global audience. Our forum is built on a transparent Peer-to-Peer network powered by programmable smart contracts to enable fair remuneration for all content and services. The Zonrix Watch2earn platform is built with the core purpose of enabling and changing the lives of content creators around the world.

Our long-term vision is to develop an open ecosystem where the content creator can build their content and services on top of the Zonrix platform. With the Zonrix App, young and innovative creative professionals or amateurs can now interact with each other and deliver their content to a global audience.

Zonrix is not just a video platform; it's a decentralized system of services supporting an active community of content creators, fans, and investors. The Zonrix platform is positioned to become the trustless reference point within the digital video market. Built on a public blockchain, Zonrix is usable from any smart device and places the creator and audience as the main protagonists, eliminating costly intermediaries and giving the creator a higher level of control over their content based revenue.

Users can connect their digital wallets to the platform and receive various rewards in the form of Zonrix tokens, just for watching and commenting on our content. No other platform gives the viewers such rewards on an ongoing basis.


Features

01-Watch-to-Earn

The audience is one of the main characters in any video platform. They are always eager to consume new content and want to interact with it. They are interested in engaging in new forms of interactive pastime. But in the traditional platform in return, they get nothing in terms of monetary value.

Zonrix is using Watch to Earn model. Which rewards users for watching the videos on the platform. Users can connect their digital wallets to the platform and receive various rewards in the form of Zonrix tokens, just for watching and commenting on our content.

02-Better UI/UX

User experience is the key to the successful long-term growth of a business. Excellent user experience is necessary to make the business thrive.

The team at Zonrix takes this concept very seriously; in fact, we have designed our platform based on a unique user experience. In the blockchain, many interactions are crude with complicated hoops and unintuitive interfaces. We have managed to shatter this barrier with infrastructure and UI/UX level experience that is intuitive and responsive to use with tested sub-second latency.

03-Monetization

Unlike other content platforms, there are no minimum entry levels for monetization like subscribers or watch hours before which the content creators or users will start earning. The Zonrix platform is designed to reward creators and viewers for their various actions on the platform right from the very start.

04-Content Creator

Content creators are the focal point of the platform. The main section of the app is made for the talented content creators who work hard in making video content like Vlogs, interviews, cooking shows, funny content, gaming videos, educational videos, or any kind of simple video content to showcase their talent with the hope of getting monetized and earn money. We support our creators by providing them with the tools they need to create, publish, operate, and monetize a variety of content. The economy of the Zonrix platform allows creators to generate additional income.

On the Zonrix platform, users can now upload their original content that they may have put on other content platforms and start earning Zonrix tokens from their very first view and very first subscriber. They can create new and engaging interactive content while relying on a progressive and transparent monetization system. Though Zonrix is more rewarding for original content creation, existing videos of content creators from other platforms are equally encouraged to be uploaded for rewards.

 Important to note that there is a strict copyright and content policy, where copyright infringement may lead to the violating accounts being banned and tokens confiscated.
