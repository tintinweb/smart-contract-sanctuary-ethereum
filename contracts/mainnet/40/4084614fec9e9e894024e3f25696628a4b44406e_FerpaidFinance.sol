Ferpaid is a payment protocol, built on the Ethereum Blockchain, designed to enable genuine cryptocurrency-based recurring payments without introducing additional friction. Its permissionless design, powered by automated smart contracts, gives crypto assets added functionality.
FERPAID FINANCE (FERPAID) is one of the most anticipated digital coins in 2022. FERPAID - owned by FMCPAY - solves both scale and usability issues in payments in the travel and service industries globally.


What is FERPAID FINANCE

FERPAID is an on-demand liquidity service. The growing FERPAID ecosystem makes it easier than ever to run the payments of a high-performance business. Blockchain 2.0 technology makes payments global, financial institutions can expand into new markets around the world and even eliminate pre-funding by leveraging the power of FERPAID.


Decentralized Platform
The platform that helps investors to make easy to purchase and sell their tokens
Future Investment
The investment that can expand into new markets around the world
Blockchain 2.0 technology
The system pay a bonus for excellent individuals

Cryptocurrency transactions, recorded on a public ledger, provide instant auditability, avoiding the possibility of dispute between buyer and seller. As a result, there is no requirement for a third party to arbitrate on whether a crypto payment has been sent and received – the blockchain reveals everything. Moreover, cryptos provide instant settlement compared to wire transfer, and do not require clearing houses, further reducing friction.
Single, recurring and on-demand payments are all facilitated via the Ferpaid protocol, making cryptocurrencies suitable for everyday use.
To allow for simple, quick and user-friendly interactions, the complexity brought by the blockchain is abstracted into simplified APIs, libraries and graphical user interfaces.
Billing models
Ferpaid offers multiple billing models that can be easily shared with customers or embedded into your website in three different ways: buttons, short urls and QR codes.



Ferpaid's offers RESTful APIs quick answers without the need to directly interact with the blockchain. The APIs, which are controlled and hosted by Ferpaid, read from a cached version of the information stored on the blockchain. Everybody can verify all of the information provided by the Ferpaid APIs with onchain data to ensure that it is accurate and up to date.


FERPAID tokens enable clients and service providers in the tourist sector with all of the benefits of blockchain technology and more.
It would be sold on many exchanges as a ERC-20Ethereumtoken, and it would readily accommodate the newest developments in blockchain technology.

Ecosystem
In the age of digitization and decentralization, the travel and hospitality business does not appear as it should. While the blockchain ecosystem is expanding, the tourist sector is missing out on the benefits of decentralization.
The FerpaidCoin project and the FERPAID FINANCE tokens that go with it are the world's first ecosystem to leverage blockchain technology to deliver an international reward system that is open to all hospitality service providers worldwide.

Introducing Ferpaid: A Defi Platform for Automatic Crypto Payments
Increased adoption of cryptocurrencies has led to growing demand for processing services to help businesses and users manage burdensome manual crypto payments, with a variety of implementations available for online and offline merchants.
Unfortunately, current solutions are somewhat disconnected from the existing defi ecosystem, lacking the convenience of a more universal service platform. So what if there was a solution that could combine the benefits of decentralized finance and automated crypto payments in one application?
That’s where Ferpaid comes in. But what exactly is Ferpaid, what benefits does it offer, and what comes next?
