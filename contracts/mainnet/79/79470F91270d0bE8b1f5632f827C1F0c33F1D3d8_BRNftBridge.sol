 * Sets have the following properties:

 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.

 * As of v3.0.0, only sets of type `address` (`AddressSet`) and `uint256`
 * (`UintSet`) are supported.

/**
 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access

 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");

 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and

 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
