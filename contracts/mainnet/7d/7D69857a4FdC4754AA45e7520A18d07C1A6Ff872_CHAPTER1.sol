CHAPTER ONE: The Blasphemous Incursion
------------------------------------------

The sun fell, bleeding a crimson pall over a tranquil sky. Winged explorers rested safely in their nests, the cool of night spreading like a tsunami, covering the forests, the plains, in a blanket of mist, a shroud of peace. Distant stars shared their incandescence, light years away, watching solemnly as the land, the world moved through its rhythms, its seasons. The magic of the FirstBorne, the spirit that had breathed this world into being, permeated all, the very air, watching, moving, waiting. 
   
A guttural scream shattered the night calm, sending small forest dwellers scurrying terrified for their burrows. Creatures within earshot shuddered, knowing viscerally that one of their own was to meet its end. A blood trail betrayed the location of the hunted, a luminous trickle of ethereal life glowing weakly against the razor-sharp volcanic crag. The broken body of a sprite lay quivering inside the entrance of a cave, its former radiance all but gone. 

The hunter, a garnasta, hadn’t bothered hiding its prideful gasconade of victory - snarling, growling, it exuded a toxic arrogance as it paced slowly and smugly up to the cave.

The sprite had a name, and a life once celebrated and enjoyed. It hadn’t sought out this fate. Its purpose had always been to connect the bumbling forest floor fauna to a greater meaning. For much of its life, it had danced in the morning dew, whilst clumsy snirklons rooted among the leaves for mucus-covered worms, rousing all who could hear to the knowledge of the FirstBorne magic. It had flittered among the branches of the Pharonn trees during the day, proselytizing to all who would listen, sensing the deep magic that had knit together the very world itself, whilst the simple and happily ignorant creatures, both small and very small, kept following their daily routines. 

It had friends: other sprites, some of the owls, the occasional ancient treefolk known for communing with other sentient beings. It had a gentle willingness to embrace the smaller ones who scampered beneath the feet of the fantastical inhabitants of this strange land. The lambent child-like creature glowed a myriad of hues, a warmth that fluctuated, as its mood flickered between love, curiosity and revere.

And so, from a life of peace and praise, this sprite was unprepared for the overwhelming violence that had confronted it the previous day. As it had gazed in wonder upon the iridescent glow of the morning mist from the Great Auel waterfalls, a jagged slime-covered boulder crashed into its ribs, sending the sprite plummeting down amongst the foliage surrounding the edge of the southern shore of the pool that received this waterfall’s thunderous outpouring. The sprite’s body immediately burned a savage red in pain and anger, an emotion it knew little of, before relenting finally to a trembling pale yellow. 

The victorious grunts and gnarring from the garnasta who had committed the foul, unprovoked attack seemed to sour the air. The ground itself convulsed, as if in revulsion at the presence of this vile intruder. The sprite had attempted with some success to subdue its luminescence, searching for refuge within the welcoming verdure, as it tried vainly to comprehend the source, the nature of the attack. 

And so the pursuit had continued, through the day, into the night, along sympathetic forest trails, ancient ravenes, through merciless thorn-berry fields, until the sprite finally lost its way and became trapped within the cave entrance. Whimpering, struggling to breathe, its chest heaving with the fear of impending finality, the trembling messenger of hope and wonder listened in horror, as a blade was dragged amongst the boulders littering the rocky ground that surrounded the cave mouth.

There seemed to be no purpose to what had occurred. No grudge, revenge or comeuppance. The sprite knew of the garnasta species, but had never imagined meeting one. Such ruination, such immense creatures of violence and senseless destruction, dwelling far beneath the sun-lit world, in caverns and tunnels, in the bowels of the land. Initially offspring of insane Gargantua and rabid goblins, the foul interbreeding had been whispered in quiet conversations, and briefly mentioned in ancient scrolls, but the sprite had never believed it would one day meet such a nightmare. 

And so the end would come. The blade scraped harshly over the volcanic scree, screeching. The sprite rested its head on the abrasive scoria, its skin almost translucent, as hope fled its plaintive heart. No tears left, bloodshot eyes slowly closed as the garnasta’s brutish head raised up and over the final boulder to view its forlorn prize.      

Squinting its sunken, beady eyes, it could barely make out the lithe body of its prey. The dark cave seemed to stare ominously at this sacrilegious act taking place. The blade almost appeared redundant, yet the bloodlust of this fallen monstrosity kept its call, and to it, this creature happily obeyed. Lifting the instrument of death, the garnasta reached in, sniggering, as its goal lay within reach. 

And so, between the mockery, and the blade’s horrendous scraping through the rocks, this formidable hunter’s ears were deaf to its own impending doom. Deep within the cave, the furious eyes of the protector, the upholder of the wylde law, burned as it gazed upon this blasphemy. This abhorrence, this tumultuous torrent of evil being expressed, brought forth an unrelenting rage. Rising up to its full height, nearly ten feet high, and spreading its feathered wings with a deadly flourish, its blade-like claws released their grip on a well worn boulder, as holy retribution coursed through the guardian’s veins. 

As the garnasta’s muscle laden arm propelled its encrusted blade through the air towards the sprite’s prone body, it felt a shift in the cave air, but was too slow to react, as an immense wall of fury collided with its chest.
