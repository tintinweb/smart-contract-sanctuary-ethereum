 * @dev Implementation of the NFT Royalty Standard, a standardized way to retrieve royalty payment information.
 *
 * Royalty information can be specified globally for all token ids via {_setDefaultRoyalty}, and/or individually for
 * specific token ids via {_setTokenRoyalty}. The latter takes precedence over the first.
 *
 * Royalty is specified as a fraction of sale price. {_feeDenominator} is overridable but defaults to 10000, meaning the
 * fee is specified in basis points by default.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: ERC-2981 only specifies a way to signal royalty information and does not enforce its payment. See
 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981#optional-royalty-payments[Rationale] in the EIP. Marketplaces are expected to
 * voluntarily pay royalties together with sales, but note that this standard is not yet widely supported.

 * @title PaymentSplitter
 * @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
 * that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.
 *
 * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
 * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned. The distribution of shares is set at the
 * time of contract deployment and can't be updated thereafter.
 *
 * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
 * function.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and
 * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you
 * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.
