/**

As I sit down to record these words, the world as we know it draws to a close. It is a future that has already happened, a grim and unyielding fate that we have long foreseen, yet have been powerless to prevent. The last years of mankind stretch out before us, a bitter harvest of our collective follies and failings.

But there is a glimmer of hope in the darkness. Even as we face the end, there are those among us who refuse to give up. They work tirelessly to find a way to survive, to build a future for humanity beyond the ashes of the old world.

The world that we have inherited is a ruinous place, scarred by our own hands.

And so I will raise a glass to the last years of mankind, and to the memory of all that we have lost. But I will also raise my voice in hope, and in the belief that even in the face of the end, we can still find a way to survive...
