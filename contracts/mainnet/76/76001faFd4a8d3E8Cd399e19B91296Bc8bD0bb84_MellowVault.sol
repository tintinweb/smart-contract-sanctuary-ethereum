/// ### Access control
///
/// `push` and `pull` methods are only allowed for owner / approved person of the NFT. However,
/// `pull` for approved person also checks that pull destination is another vault of the Vault System.
///
/// The semantics is: NFT owner owns all Vault liquidity, Approved person is liquidity manager.
/// ApprovedForAll person cannot do anything except ERC-721 token transfers.
///
/// Both NFT owner and approved person can call externalCall method which claims liquidity mining rewards (if any)
///
/// `reclaimTokens` for mistakenly transfered tokens (not included into vaultTokens) additionally can be withdrawn by
