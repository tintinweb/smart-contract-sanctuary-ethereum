/**
 * @title Optimistic Asserter.
 * @notice The OA is used to assert truths about the world which are verified using an optimistic escalation game.
 * @dev Core idea: an asserter makes a statement about a truth, calling "assertTruth". If this statement is not
 * challenged, it is taken as the state of the world. If challenged, it is arbitrated using the UMA DVM, or if
 * configured, an escalation manager. Escalation managers enable integrations to define their own security properties and
 * tradeoffs, enabling the notion of "sovereign security".
